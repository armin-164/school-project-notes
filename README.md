# Notes
This is the notes assignment for the API course at Medieinstitutet. Note: this assignment has the 
basic requirements for the highest grade of this specific assignment. No more has been added at
this time but this will be worked on in the future or I will create a new project that revisits this idea
but with more knowledge.

### Commands
To experiment with this project, you will need to setup your own SQL server.
In /backend/lib/connect.js you will need to add your own "host" and "port" values.
Run these commands:

// This will install all packages necessary for this project
- pnpm install

// Run this in the frontend folder to start dev mode 
- pnpm run dev

// Run this in the backend folder to run node on each file save
- nodemon start
